- Configured Git authentication with Personal Access Token
- Successfully connected to GitHub repository

### 2. Branch Management ✅
- Created feature branch: `feature/github-tools-demo`
- Demonstrated branching workflow
- Successfully pushed multiple commits

### 3. File Operations ✅
- Created multiple documentation files
- Generated CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Added testing infrastructure
- Implemented repository status checking script

### 4. GitHub Actions Integration ✅
- Created `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- Configured automated testing for frontend/backend
- Added code quality checks
- Set up deployment pipeline

### 5. Security Compliance ✅
- Handled GitHub push protection for secrets
- Removed sensitive token information
- Demonstrated secure development practices

## Files Created During Demo

### Documentation
- `Document/test-mcp.md` - Initial MCP testing file
- `Document/github-tools-test.md` - GitHub tools testing documentation
- `Document/mcp-testing-results.md` - Comprehensive testing results
- `Document/ci-cd-setup.md` - CI/CD pipeline documentation
- `Document/testing-config.md` - Testing configuration guide

### Infrastructure

## Workflow Demonstrated

```
1. Create feature branch
   ↓
2. Add documentation and infrastructure files
   ↓
3. Commit changes with meaningful messages
   ↓
4. Handle security issues (token protection)
   ↓
5. Push to remote repository
   ↓
6. Ready for Pull Request creation
```

## Next Steps for Production Use
